NetApp periodically updates Converged Systems Advisor to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

To confirm FlexPod components are supported by the CSA agent, reference the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] (IMT).

== 23 April 2020
This release includes the following enhancements:

* <<Upgrade Advisor>>
* <<Cluster interconnect switch>>
* <<Capacity card enhancements>>
* <<System diagram alerts>>

=== Upgrade Advisor
Now you can check compatibility for your VMWare vCenter and ONTAP versions with your Nexus and UCS components. To check compability, use Upgrade Advisor in the dashboard under Firmware Interoperability. All versions you see are supported.

=== Cluster interconnect switch
In the portal, we added cluster interconnect switch (CIS) under Firmware Interoperability in the Dashboard view. Now you can monitor the supportability of ONTAP cluster interconnect switches for the following models:

* Cisco Nexus 3132Q-V
* Cisco Nexus 3232C
* Cisco Nexus 92300YC

== 7 November 2019

//All of the new features and enhancements in this release are automatically included after you add your Flexpod into CSA. Follow the instructions in link:task_getting_started.html#getting-task_getting_started>[Getting Started] to add your FlexPod as a Converged Infrastructure into CSA.

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

* <<MetroCluster awareness>>
* <<NVMe awareness>>
* <<Improved interoperability functionality>>

=== MetroCluster awareness
Converged Systems Advisor now supports adding a single site of a MetroCluster FlexPod as a converged infrastructure. Analytics will now be able to determine the health of both sides of the MetroCluster.

=== NVMe awareness
Converged Systems Advisor will now run analytics to check the configuration of the NVMe protocol which is supported on ONTAP 9.4 and above.

=== Improved interoperability functionality
Converged Systems Advisor has an updated interoperability card that will link to a pop up that shows the current, nearest, and latest versions supported for each component. A new report has been added in the pop up to show an individualized Interoperability report per component tier.


== 24 July 2019

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

* <<Support for Cisco ACI in FlexPod>>
* <<Support for multiple clusters in a single FlexPod>>

=== Support for Cisco ACI in FlexPod

Converged Systems Advisor now supports FlexPod designs with Cisco ACI Networking.  The support and configuration of all devices in your FlexPod will be evaluated, even the two dynamically determined leaf switches connected to your other FlexPod devices.

=== Support for multiple clusters in a single FlexPod

Converged Systems Advisor now supports multiple clusters in a single FlexPod. Storage ONTAP rules are processed on all clusters and all clusters are reflected on the system diagram.
