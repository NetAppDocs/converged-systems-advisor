After you configure the agent, it sends information about each FlexPod device to the Converged Systems Advisor portal. You must now select each of those components in the portal to create an entire infrastructure that you can monitor.

.Steps
. In the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^], click *Add Infrastructure*.
. Complete the steps to add the infrastructure:
.. Enter basic details about the infrastructure.
+
If you are adding a Cisco ACI Infrastructure, enter *yes* when asked if your FlexPod uses Cisco UCS Manager; and enter *Nexus switch in ACI mode* when asked the type of Network Configuration your FlexPod contains.
.. Select each device that is part of the FlexPod configuration.
+
TIP: When you select a device, the Eligibility column displays either *Eligible* or *Not Eligible*. A device is not eligible if it was discovered by a different agent.

+
Once you have selected all of the required components, you should see a green checkmark next to each device type.

.. Review the summary, accept the terms of the license agreement, and click *Add Infrastructure*.

.Result
Converged Systems Advisor adds the infrastructure to the portal and starts collecting configuration data about each device. Wait a few minutes for the agent to collect information from the devices.
