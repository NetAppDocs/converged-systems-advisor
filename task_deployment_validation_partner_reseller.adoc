As a partner or reseller, you can validate the deployment of your customer's infrastructure by reviewing alerts for failed rules and warnings. You can also generate a deployment validation report.

== Prepare for the validation process

Partners and resellers use their own NetApp credentials to log in to their customers' systems to start the validation process.

.Before you start

* You have installed a new FlexPod at your customer site, or you are working with an existing FlexPod.

* You created accounts on FlexPod devices.

* You downloaded and installed the agent.  Refer to link:task_getting_started.html[Get started with Converged System Advisor for customers].

//comment//

* You set up the networking for the agent and installed an SSL certificate on the agent.

* With your NetApp credentials, you created the CI for your customer to add the infrastructure to the portal.

* Optionally, you shared the infrastructure with other users.

* If you are using a TACACS+ server, you granted CSA user privileges.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^] using your NetApp credentials.


== Review alerts for failed rules and warnings

Converged Systems Advisor continuously monitors the infrastructure and generates warnings and failures to ensure that the system is configured and performing to best practices.

.Steps

. After you log in, click *Rules*.
+
The Rules page displays a summary of all rules. The status for each rule is either *Pass*, *Warning*, or *Fail*.

. Click the filter icon in the Status column and select *Fail*, *Warning*, or both.
+

. Review details about individual rules by clicking the arrow next to the Status column.
+

. Follow the instructions in the resolution to fix the issue.
+
If needed, <<Reviewing the history for an infrastructure,review the configuration history>> for the infrastructure to help you resolve the issue.

.After you finish

The status for the rules that you addressed should display as Pass after the agent's next collection period.


== Display suppressed rules
.Steps

. Click the *Settings* icon and select *Suppressed Rules*.
+

. Select the suppressed rules that you want to begin displaying.

. Click the *Alerts* icon.
+

. Select *End Suppression* and then click *Submit*.

.Result

Alerts are enabled for the selected rule and the rule is displayed in the Rules table and dashboard.

NetApp partners can run a deployment validation to verify that a FlexPod converged infrastructure is configured correctly. Partners can then hand off the report to customers.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^].

. Expand the customer's configuration from the Customer List.
+
image:screenshot_partner_customer_list.gif[Shows three converged infrastructures for a customer.]

. Under Deployment Validation Report, click *Generate*.

. Choose whether you want to view the report in your browser, in a PDF, or via email.

. Review the report and correct any interoperability issues and deployment validation errors.
+
*Example*
+
In this sample configuration, the firmware versions of the Nexus switches are not supported:
+
image:screenshot_validation_interop.gif[Shows the interoperability section of the Deployment Validation Report. It includes two switches with unsupported firmware versions.]
+
Four validation rules also failed due to issues with switch connectivity:
+
image:screenshot_validation_errors.gif[Shows the errors section of the Deployment Validation Report. The fabric interconnect does not uplink into the corresponding Nexus Fibre Channel fabric.]
+
Upgrading the firmware can correct the interoperability of the configuration and adding the links can correct the failed validation rules.

. After you correct the issues, collect data to ensure that Converged Systems Advisor has the latest configuration data:

.. Select the converged infrastructure.

.. In the upper right, click *Collect*.
+
image:screenshot_collect_button.gif[Shows the collect button in the upper right that is available after selecting a converged infrastructure.]

. Generate the report again to verify that you have corrected the issues.

. Send the final Deployment Validation Report to your customer.

.Result

The converged infrastructure is now set up according to best practices.
