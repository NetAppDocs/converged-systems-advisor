If you have a Premium license, you can generate several types of reports that provide details about the current status of your converged infrastructure: an inventory report, a health report, an assessment report, a deployment validation report for partners, and more.

.Steps

. Click *Reports*.

. Select a report and click *Generate*.

. Choose your options for the report:
.. Select a converged infrastructure.
.. Optionally change from the most recent data collection to a previous one.
.. Choose how you want to view the report: in your browser, as a downloaded PDF, or via email.

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor generates the report.

== Generate deployment validation report for partners
NetApp partners can run a deployment validation to verify that a FlexPod converged infrastructure is configured correctly. Partners can then hand off the report to customers.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^].

. Expand the customer's configuration from the Customer List.

. Under Deployment Validation Report, click *Generate*.

. Choose whether you want to view the report in your browser, in a PDF, or via email.

. Review the report and correct any interoperability issues and deployment validation errors.
+
*Example*
+
In this sample configuration, the firmware versions of the Nexus switches are not supported:

+
Four validation rules also failed due to issues with switch connectivity:
+

+
Upgrading the firmware can correct the interoperability of the configuration and adding the links can correct the failed validation rules.

. After you correct the issues, collect data to ensure that Converged Systems Advisor has the latest configuration data:

.. Select the converged infrastructure.

.. In the upper right, click *Collect*.
+

. Generate the report again to verify that you have corrected the issues.

. Send the final Deployment Validation Report to your customer.

.Result

The converged infrastructure is now set up according to best practices.
