If you are a NetApp partner, you can get started with Converged Systems Advisor by working with your customer to deploy the agent and set up the portal before you run a deployment validation.

== Getting Converged Systems Advisor up and running in your customer's environment

Your customer must deploy the Converged Systems Advisor agent and set up the portal before you can validate the converged infrastructure deployment.

Work with your customer to perform the following steps:

. Prepare the environment.
. Install and configure the Converged Systems Advisor agent.
. Add the converged infrastructure to the Converged Systems Advisor portal.
. Share the converged infrastructure with you.

For instructions, see link:task_getting_started_customers.html[Getting started with Converged Systems Advisor for customers].

== Validating a converged infrastructure deployment

NetApp partners can run a deployment validation to verify that a FlexPod converged infrastructure is configured correctly. Partners can then hand off the report to customers.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^].

. Expand the customer's configuration from the Customer List.

. Under Deployment Validation Report, click *Generate*.

. Choose whether you want to view the report in your browser, in a PDF, or via email.

. Review the report and correct any interoperability issues and deployment validation errors.

*Example*
+
In this sample configuration, the firmware versions of the Nexus switches are not supported:

Four validation rules also failed due to issues with switch connectivity:

+
Upgrading the firmware can correct the interoperability of the configuration and adding the links can correct the failed validation rules.

. After you correct the issues, collect data to ensure that Converged Systems Advisor has the latest configuration data:

.. Select the converged infrastructure.

.. In the upper right, click *Collect*.

. Generate the report again to verify that you have corrected the issues.

. Send the final Deployment Validation Report to your customer.

.Result

The converged infrastructure is now set up according to best practices.
