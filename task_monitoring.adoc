You can monitor your converged infrastructure by responding to alerts, reviewing a history of changes, and generating reports that provide a holistic view of an infrastructure.

== Reviewing alerts for failed rules and warnings

Converged Systems Advisor continuously monitors your infrastructure and generates warnings and failures to ensure that the system is configured and performing to best practices.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://csa.netapp.com/[Converged Systems Advisor portal^] and click *Rules*.
+
The Rules page displays a summary of all rules. The status for each rule is either *Pass*, *Warning*, or *Fail*.

. Click the filter icon in the Status column and select *Fail*, *Warning*, or both.
+

. Review details about individual rules by clicking the arrow next to the Status column.
+

. Follow the instructions in the resolution to fix the issue.
+
If needed, <<Reviewing the history for an infrastructure,review the configuration history>> for the infrastructure to help you resolve the issue.

.After you finish

The status for the rules that you addressed should display as Pass after the agent's next collection period.

== Reviewing the history for an infrastructure

When you receive an alert about a failed rule, you can view a history of what changed in the configuration to help you resolve the issue.

.Steps

. Select a converged infrastructure.

. Click *More > History*.
+

. Click a day on the calendar to view the number of warnings and failures that were identified during each data collection.
+
TIP: The number that appears for each day corresponds to the number of times that the agent collected data. For example, if you keep the default collection interval of 24 hours, you should see one collection per day.
+
The following image shows a single collection on the 27th of the month.
+

. To view more details about the data that was collected, click *Go to CI Dashboard* for a collection.

. If needed, view the history for the last time that no warnings or failures were identified.
+
Comparing the data between the two collection periods can help you identify what changed.

== Changing the notifications that you receive

If you receive alert notifications that you do not plan to address, you can configure Converged Systems Advisor to stop sending email notifications for that rule. For example, enabling telnet is not recommended, but if you prefer to enable it, you can suppress the rule.

.About this task

You must have the Premium license to configure notifications.

.Steps

. Click *Rules*.

. Find the rules that you are looking for by filtering the contents of the table.

. Select one or more rows for rules that have a status of Warning or Fail and then click the *Alerts* icon.
+
image:screenshot_rules_suppress.gif[Shows the alerts icon above the table which enables you to suppress rules.]

. Select a duration and then click *Submit*.
+
TIP: If you want to enable the alerts, follow these same steps and select *End Suppression*.

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor no longer notifies you about the rule for the specified duration.

== Generating reports

If you have a Premium license, you can generate several types of reports that provide details about the current status of your converged infrastructure: an inventory report, a health report, an assessment report, and more.

.Steps

. Click *Reports*.

. Select a report and click *Generate*.

. Choose your options for the report:
.. Select a converged infrastructure.
.. Optionally change from the most recent data collection to a previous one.
.. Choose how you want to view the report: in your browser, as a downloaded PDF, or via email.
+

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor generates the report.

== Tracking support contracts

You can add details about support contracts for each device in a configuration: the start date, end date, and contract ID. This enables you to easily track the details in a central location so you know when to renew support contracts for each device.

.Steps

. Click *Select a CI* and select the converged infrastructure.

. In the Support Contract widget, click the *Edit contract* icon.

. Select the *Start Date* and *End Date* and enter the *Contract ID*.

. Click *Submit*.

. Repeat the steps for each device in the configuration.

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor now displays the support contract details for each device. You can easily see which devices have active and expired support contracts.
