You can monitor your converged infrastructure by responding to alerts, reviewing a history of changes, and generating reports that provide a holistic view of an infrastructure.

== Reviewing alerts for failed rules and warnings

Converged Systems Advisor continuously monitors your infrastructure and generates warnings and failures to ensure that the system is configured and performing to best practices.

.Steps

+
The Rules page displays a summary of all rules. The status for each rule is either *Pass*, *Warning*, or *Fail*.

. Click the filter icon in the Status column and select *Fail*, *Warning*, or both.
+

. Follow the instructions in the resolution to fix the issue.
+
If needed, <<Reviewing the history for an infrastructure,review the configuration history>> for the infrastructure to help you resolve the issue.

.After you finish

The status for the rules that you addressed should display as Pass after the agent's next collection period.

== Dynamically generated resolution for failed rules

If your infrastructure fails to pass certain rules, you can select to have Converged Systems Advisor dynamically generate the converged operations to take against your converged infrastructure to resolve the issues causing the failures.

.About this task

The Rules page displays a summary of all rules. The status for each rule is either *Pass*, *Warning*, or *Fail*.

. Select *Filter rules that can be remediated*.

. Expand the rule that you want to resolve.

+
If the image:wrench_icon.jpg[Shows the wrench icon which enables you to automatically fix failed rules.] appears is not clickable and appears light gray, the rule cannot be resolved when the agent is offline or user is not the owner or the converged license is not Premium.

. If necessary, fill in the input values.
+
Depending on the failed rule, some input values are necessary to resolve the issue.

. If you want a data collection to be taken after the successful completion of the remediation, then select the option *Collect When Remediation Job Completes*.

== Suppressing failed rules

Converged Systems Advisor allows you to suppress rules so that do not show up in dashboard and no longer send email notifications on rule failure.

. Select a duration and then click *Submit*.

TIP: If you want to enable the alerts, follow these same steps and select *End Suppression*.

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor no longer notifies you about the rule for the specified duration and the rule will no longer be visible in the dashboard.

== Displaying suppressed rules

You can view the list of rules that have been suppressed and, if desired, select to end the suppression.

.Steps

. Click the *Settings* icon and select *Suppressed Rules*.
+

== Reviewing the history for an infrastructure

When you receive an alert about a failed rule, you can view a history of what changed in the configuration to help you resolve the issue.

.Steps

. Select a converged infrastructure.

. Click *More > History*.
+
image:screenshot_history_navigation.gif[Shows the More menu which includes the history option.]

. Click a day on the calendar to view the number of warnings and failures that were identified during each data collection.
+
TIP: The number that appears for each day corresponds to the number of times that the agent collected data. For example, if you keep the default collection interval of 24 hours, you should see one collection per day.
+
The following image shows a single collection on the 27th of the month.
+
image:screenshot_history_status.gif[Shows the number one and one yellow dot on the 27th of the month.]

. To view more details about the data that was collected, click *Go to CI Dashboard* for a collection.

. If needed, view the history for the last time that no warnings or failures were identified.
+
Comparing the data between the two collection periods can help you identify what changed.

== Generating reports

If you have a Premium license, you can generate several types of reports that provide details about the current status of your converged infrastructure: an inventory report, a health report, an assessment report, and more.

.Steps

. Click *Reports*.

. Select a report and click *Generate*.

. Choose your options for the report:
.. Select a converged infrastructure.
.. Optionally change from the most recent data collection to a previous one.
.. Choose how you want to view the report: in your browser, as a downloaded PDF, or via email.
+
image:screenshot_reports_generate.gif[Shows the options for generating a report, which includes selecting a converged infrastructure and a snapshot, and then choosing how you want to view it.]

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor generates the report.

== Tracking support contracts

You can add details about support contracts for each device in a configuration: the start date, end date, and contract ID. This enables you to easily track the details in a central location so you know when to renew support contracts for each device.

.Steps

. Click *Select a CI* and select the converged infrastructure.

. In the Support Contract widget, click the *Edit contract* icon.

. Select the *Start Date* and *End Date* and enter the *Contract ID*.

. Click *Submit*.

. Repeat the steps for each device in the configuration.

.Result

Converged Systems Advisor now displays the support contract details for each device. You can easily see which devices have active and expired support contracts.
