. Click a day on the calendar to view the number of warnings and failures that were identified during each data collection.
+
TIP: The number that appears for each day corresponds to the number of times that the agent collected data. For example, if you keep the default collection interval of 24 hours, you should see one collection per day.
+
The following image shows a single collection on the 27th of the month.

. To view more details about the data that was collected, click *Go to CI Dashboard* for a collection.

. If needed, view the history for the last time that no warnings or failures were identified.

Comparing the data between the two collection periods can help you identify what changed.
